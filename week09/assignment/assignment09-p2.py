Course: CSE 251 
Lesson Week: 09
File: assignment09-p2.py 
Author: <Add name here>

Purpose: Part 2 of assignment 09, finding the end position in the maze

Instructions:
- Do not create classes for this assignment, just functions.
- Do not use any other Python modules other than the ones included.
- Each thread requires a different color by calling get_color().


This code is not interested in finding a path to the end position,
However, once you have completed this program, describe how you could 
change the program to display the found path to the exit position.

What would be your strategy?  

<Answer here>

Why would it work?
