# 08 Teach: Merge Sort

## Overview

The [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is "an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm."

## Assignment

The code found in `team\team.py` contains a working merge function that sorts 1,000,000 numbers in a list.  You will be changing the program to;

1. Implement the function `merge_sort_thread()` to use threads in the recursion.  When your merge function makes a recursive call to itself, you will create a new thread to handle that function.
1. Implement the function `merge_sort_process()` to use processes in the recursion.  When your merge function makes a recursive call to itself, you will create a new process to handle that function.

## Sample Solution

No solution provided.

## Submission

When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.

If you decided to do additional work on the program after your team activity, either by yourself or with others, feel free to include that additional work when you report on your progress in I-Learn.
