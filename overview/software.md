We will be using Python throughtout the course. Please ensure that you have version 3.10 or higher (It is prefered to have the latest version of Python).  Also, make sure you have the latest update for the version of Python that you are using.  For example, version `3.10.0` has issues in this course but version `3.10.9` doesn't.  Python can be [downloaded here](python.org).

## **Visual Studio Code (vscode)**

There are a number of code editors available to programmers.  You are free to use any editor that you want.  However, the course will use Visual Studio Code as the editor in video examples and during class time.  VSCode can be downloaded at [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Packages to install in VSCode 

When you open a Python file, VSCode will want you to install the Python Package from MicroSoft.  Please install it.

### Packages to install in Python

The course uses the following Python packages that must be installed on your computer.  A computer can have more than one version of Python.  It is important that these packages are installed on the version of Python that is used in VSCode.

1. Open VSCode and create a Python file that will print out `Hello World`

```python
print('Hello World')
```

2. Run the program and notice the output in the terminal window.  (**Note**: you can't run a Python file until you save it on your computer).  The text that is displayed in yellow (In this image.  You may not have it displayed in yellow) is the location of Python that VSCode is using on my computer.  Your path will be different.

3. Select and copy the full Python path and paste it in that terminal window.  Include any quotes that might be around this path.  In most cases for Mac users, the python path will just be `python3`.  You will have quotes if the path has spaces in it.  Then add the options `-m pip install <package>` where `<package>` is the name of the package you want to install.  For example: In the case of numpy, it would be `-m pip install numpy`.

Note that Mac users might need to add `--user` to the install command line.  Also, Mac users can try `pip3 install --user <package>` in the terminal app to see if that works on their computer.


### Packages that are installed with Python

We will be using the following packages that are already installed on you computers.

- **threading**: Threading package that allows for the creation and management of threads
- **multiprocessor**: Process package that allows for the creation and management of processes


## cse251 library

There is classes and functions that will be used throughout the course.  These are found in the Python file `cse251.py` in the folder `code`.

Please follow link for more information [CSE251 Common Code](cse251_code.md)
