Course: CSE 251
Lesson Week: Week 07
File: team.py
Purpose: Week 07 Team Activity

Instructions:

1) Make a copy of your assignment 2 program.  Since you are 
   working in a team, you can decide which assignment 2 program 
   that you will use for the team activity.

2) Convert the program to use a process pool and use 
   apply_async() with a callback function to retrieve data 
   from the Star Wars website.  Each request for data must 
   be a apply_async() call.

3) You can continue to use the Request_Thread() class from 
   assignment 02 that makes the call to the server.
