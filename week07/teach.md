# 07 Teach: Using apply_async()

## Overview

We will be learning about using the pool function apply_async().

## Assignment

You will be using the process pool apply_async() function to change your assignment 2 program.

### Requirements

1. Make a copy of your assignment 2 program.  Since you are working in a team, you can decide which assignment 2 program that you will use for the team activity.
1. Convert the program to use a process pool and use apply_async() with a callback function to retrieve data from the Star Wars website.  Each request for data must be a apply_async() call.
1. You can continue to use the Request_Thread() class from assignment 02 that makes the call to the server.

## Sample Solution

No solution provided.

## Submission

When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.

If you decided to do additional work on the program after your team activity, either by yourself or with others, feel free to include that additional work when you report on your progress in I-Learn.
