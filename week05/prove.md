# 05 Prove: Factories and Dealerships

## Overview

You will be using queue(s) and thread semaphore(s) to synchronize many threads in the production and selling of cars.

## Project Description

This is a continuation of assignment 04.  Instead of one factory and one dealership, will have multiple of each.  The restriction of only producing `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` is still in place for all of the dealerships.

## Assignment

1. Download the [assignment.py](assignment/assignment.py) file.
2. Review the instructions found in the Python file as well as the global constants.
4. The function `run_production()` will be passed different number of factories and dealerships that are to be created for a production run.
1. You must not use the Python queue object for this assignment.  Use the class Queue251().

Here is a sample run of the completed assignment.  The number of cars each factory produces is random:
